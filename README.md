# WIP - tesi_db - WIP

This repo hosts a project for my Masters Dissertation on Electronic Publishing; it consists in the digitisation of a diary written between 1901 and 1903 by the prison guard Pasquale Riccioni.  

Image APIs of high-quality scans of the pages will first be integrated in a [IIIF manifest](https://dariobaldini98.github.io/tesi_db/iiif/tesi_db_manifest.json), in order to produce a Presentation API of the diary. The text will then be encoded in the TEI markup language.  
Both these resources will eventually be published on a dedicated website: clients like [Universal Viewer](https://uv-v4.netlify.app/#?manifest=https://dariobaldini98.github.io/tesi_db/iiif/tesi_db_manifest.json) and [Mirador 3](https://projectmirador.org/embed/?iiif-content=https://dariobaldini98.github.io/tesi_db/iiif/tesi_db_manifest.json) will display the scans, while the TEI transcription will be rendered through specific CSS style sheets.  

Links will be provided in this readme as soon as avaiable.
