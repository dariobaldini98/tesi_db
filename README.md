# WIP - tesi_db - WIP

This repo hosts a project for my Masters Dissertation on Electronic Publishing; it consists in the digitisation of a diary written by Pasquale Riccioni in the early twentieth century.  
The project consists of two main parts: 
- a [IIIF manifest](https://dariobaldini98.github.io/tesi_db/iiif/tesi_db_manifest.json) with which to view, through clients like [Universal Viewer](https://uv-v4.netlify.app/#?manifest=https://dariobaldini98.github.io/tesi_db/iiif/tesi_db_manifest.json) and [Mirador 3](https://projectmirador.org/embed/?iiif-content=https://dariobaldini98.github.io/tesi_db/iiif/tesi_db_manifest.json), high quality scans of the pages;
- the transcription and encoding of the text in the TEI markup language.  
It will eventually be made public on a dedicated website.
