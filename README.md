# Riccioni's Legacy

This repo hosts a project for my MA Dissertation on Electronic Publishing which consists in the digitisation of a diary written between 1901 and 1903 by the prison guard Pasquale Riccioni.  

### The website is online at the following [link](https://dariobaldini98.github.io/tesi_db/tesi_db_homepage.html)!  

The project comprises the following parts:  

- [IIIF Image APIs ([Image Requests](https://iiif.archivelab.org/iiif/tesi_db_1r/full/full/0/default.jpg) and  [Image Information Requests](https://iiif.archivelab.org/iiif/tesi_db_1r/info.json)) (eg. *r1*) of page scans, obtained with the [Archive Labs IIIF service](https://training.iiif.io/iiif-online-workshop/day-two/image-servers/iiif-hosting-ia.html);  
- [IIIF Presentation API of a manifest](/tesi_db_manifest.json);  

- [TEI encoding of the transcription](/tesi_db_text.xml) (**till *10r* atm - see below**)  

- a website for its publication, composed of 4 pages:
  - [informative homepage in HTML](/tesi_db_homepage.html);  
  - 2 pages with JS viewers:  
    - [Universal Viewer](/tesi_db_uv.html);  
    - [Mirador 3](/tesi_db_mira.html);  
  - [XSL document to turn the TEI encoding into XHTML](/tesi_db_transfo.xsl);  
  - [CSS document to style the website](/tesi_db_style.css);
