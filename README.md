# WIP - tesi_db - WIP

This repo hosts a project for my Masters Dissertation on Electronic Publishing; it consists in the digitisation of a diary written between 1901 and 1903 by the prison guard Pasquale Riccioni.  

I'll work on two different kind of digitisation: 
- a [IIIF manifest](https://dariobaldini98.github.io/tesi_db/iiif/tesi_db_manifest.json), in order to display high quality scans of the pages through clients like [Universal Viewer](https://uv-v4.netlify.app/#?manifest=https://dariobaldini98.github.io/tesi_db/iiif/tesi_db_manifest.json) and [Mirador 3](https://projectmirador.org/embed/?iiif-content=https://dariobaldini98.github.io/tesi_db/iiif/tesi_db_manifest.json);
- the encoding of the text in the TEI markup language, whose transcription will eventually be published on a dedicated website.  

Links will be provided as soon as the resources above are avaiable.
