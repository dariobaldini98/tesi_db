# WIP - tesi_db - WIP

This repo hosts a project for my Masters Dissertation on Electronic Publishing; it consists in the digitisation of a diary written by Pasquale Riccioni in the early twentieth century. 
The project consists of two main parts: the creation of an IIIF manifest with which to view, through specific clients, high quality scans of the pages; the transcription and encoding of the text in the TEI markup language. It will eventually be made public on a html website.
